Here is a list of subtopics that are usually covered under Active Components:

1. **Transistors**: Transistors are active components that can amplify or switch electronic signals. They are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including amplifiers, oscillators, and digital circuits.

2. **Operational Amplifiers**: Operational amplifiers (op-amps) are active components that can amplify, filter, and perform mathematical operations on electronic signals. They are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including audio equipment, signal processing circuits, and control systems.

3. **Integrated Circuits**: Integrated circuits (ICs) are active components that contain multiple transistors, diodes, and other components on a single chip. They are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including computers, smartphones, and automotive systems.

4. **Diodes**: Diodes are active components that allow current to flow in one direction only. They are used for rectification, voltage regulation, and signal modulation.

5. **Thyristors**: Thyristors are active components that can switch high currents with low power inputs. They are used in power control circuits and motor control circuits.

6. **Amplifiers**: Amplifiers are active components that can increase the amplitude of an electronic signal. They are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including audio equipment, radio transmitters, and medical equipment.

7. **Oscillators**: Oscillators are active components that can generate periodic waveforms at specific frequencies. They are used in a wide range of electronic devices, including clocks, radios, and computers.
