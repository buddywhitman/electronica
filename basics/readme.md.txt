## Analog Electronics
Analog electronics deals with the study of electronic circuits that use continuous signals to represent information. The syllabus includes circuit variables, circuit elements, techniques of circuit analysis, network theorems, transient response of circuits, sinusoidal steady-state analysis, frequency response, two-port networks, and analog filters.

I apologize for the oversight. Here is a list of subtopics that you can cover under electrical circuit analysis and analog filters:

1. Fundamentals of electrical circuit analysis
2. Passive components: resistors, capacitors, inductors
3. Active components: diodes, transistors, operational amplifiers (op-amps)
4. Amplifiers: voltage amplifiers, current amplifiers, power amplifiers
5. Oscillators: sinusoidal oscillators, relaxation oscillators
6. Filters: low-pass filters, high-pass filters, band-pass filters, band-stop filters
7. Signal generators: waveform generators, function generators
8. Modulation and demodulation techniques

You can also explore the following resources to learn more about these topics:
