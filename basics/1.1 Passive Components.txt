Here is a list of subtopics that are usually covered under Passive Components:

1. **Resistors**: Resistors are passive components that resist the flow of electric current. They are used to limit current, divide voltages, and terminate transmission lines.

2. **Capacitors**: Capacitors are passive components that store electrical energy in an electric field. They are used for filtering, decoupling, and energy storage.

3. **Inductors**: Inductors are passive components that store electrical energy in a magnetic field. They are used for filtering, energy storage, and impedance matching.

4. **Transformers**: Transformers are passive components that transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. They are used for voltage conversion, impedance matching, and isolation.

5. **Diodes**: Diodes are passive components that allow current to flow in one direction only. They are used for rectification, voltage regulation, and signal modulation.

6. **Switches**: Switches are passive components that can open or close a circuit. They are used for signal routing, power switching, and logic control.

7. **Fuses**: Fuses are passive components that protect circuits from overcurrent conditions. They are used for safety and protection.

8. **Cables and Connectors**: Cables and connectors are passive components that provide electrical connections between circuits and devices.
