Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a list of subtopics that you can cover under analog filters:

1. Fundamentals of active filter synthesis
2. First and second-order circuit synthesis
3. Standard low-pass filters: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Inverse Chebyshev, Cauer, Bessel
4. Frequency transformations
5. Sensitivity analysis
6. Noise analysis

You can also explore the following resources to learn more about analog filters:
