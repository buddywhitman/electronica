Transient and steady-state analysis is also known as **time-domain analysis**. It is a method of analyzing the behavior of a dynamic system over time. The transient response of a system is the response of the system as it approaches its steady-state condition, while the steady-state response is the response of the system after it has reached its steady-state condition ¹²³⁴⁵. 
I apologize for the oversight. Here is a list of subtopics that you can cover under transient and steady state analysis:

1. Fundamentals of electrical circuit analysis
2. Transient response analysis
    * Standard test signals
    * First-order and second-order systems
    * Higher-order systems
    * Transient response of system
    * Steady-state error for unit, ramp, and parabolic inputs
3. Steady-state response analysis
4. Stability analysis using Routh-Hurwitz and Nyquist criteria
5. Bode plots
6. Root loci
7. Lag, lead, and lead-lag compensators
8. P, PI, and PID controllers

Transient and steady-state behavior of capacitors and inductors are covered under **transient response analysis** and **steady-state response analysis** respectively ¹²³⁴⁵. 

I hope this helps!.
