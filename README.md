### Basics
**Passive Components**
Passive components are electronic components that do not require an external power source. They include resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and diodes.

    - **Resistors**: Resistors are passive components that resist the flow of electrical current. They are used to control the amount of current in a circuit and to reduce voltage levels.

    - **Capacitors**: Capacitors are passive components that store electrical energy in an electric field. They are used to filter out noise from a signal, to store energy, and to block DC signals while allowing AC signals to pass.

    - **Inductors**: Inductors are passive components that store electrical energy in a magnetic field. They are used in filters, transformers, and power supplies.

    - **Transformers**: Transformers are passive components that transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. They are used in power supplies, amplifiers, and audio equipment.

    - **Diodes**: Diodes are passive components that allow current to flow in only one direction. They are used in rectifiers, voltage regulators, and power supplies.

**Active Components**
Active components are electronic components that require an external power source to function. They include transistors, operational amplifiers (op-amps), and integrated circuits (ICs).

**Electrical Circuit Analysis**
    - **Transistors**: Transistors are active components that amplify or switch electronic signals. They are used in amplifiers, oscillators, and digital circuits.

    - **Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)**: Op-amps are active components that amplify or attenuate electronic signals. They are used in filters, oscillators, and audio equipment.

    - **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**: ICs are active components that contain multiple transistors, diodes, and resistors on a single chip. They are used in microprocessors, memory chips, and digital circuits.
